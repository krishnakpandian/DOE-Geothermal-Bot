    "French scientists have found that geothermal wells happen to also be a cost effective way to chemically lock large amounts of CO2 into mineral deposits deep underground.",
    "The US Department of Energy estimates that more than 10x the total energy usage of the USA could feasibly be generated from Deep Enhanced Geothermal Energy in the future on US land alone.",
    "Drilling ultra-deep geothermal wells today can cost 20 Million dollars or more! But new technologies like Hydrothermal Spallation Drilling, hypersonic drilling and gyrotron laser drilling are poised to dramatically cut these costs.",
    "EGS fracturing can initially use several hundred thousand gallons of water. However, this water can come from non-potable sources.",
    "Today’s volcanic geothermal comes with unique challenges: In 2018, eruptions of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island affected Puna Geothermal Venture and forced a shut down. ",
    "Lava covered three of the plant’s 11 geothermal wells and burned a substation and adjacent warehouse. The plant operator was able to implement contingency plans that protected the geothermal steam field and power plant from the worst effects",
    "Geothermal is the only non-nuclear renewable that can change energy output on the fly. By temporarily limiting flow, the deep geothermal liquid is “charged” like a thermal battery, which can be released as extra power when energy demand peaks.",
    "Geothermal can “Black start” meaning it has the ability to restart without relying on such external electricity. The black-start process can energize the transmission system enough to bring other generators online and return the system to operation.",
    "In some areas Geothermal well water contains dissolved valuable minerals which add value to geothermal operations.",
    "In Cornwall, England plans are underway to combine a lithium production plant with an enhanced geothermal well which will refine the dissolved lithium out of the well water, making it the most environmentally friendly.",
    "A geothermal plant will generate 2-4 times as much electricity as a wind or solar plant of the same capacity due to its high capacity factor or CF. This is because geothermal always runs at a high efficiency, regardless of environmental conditions.",
    "Many old oil wells can be retrofitted into closed loop AGS systems because they still reach high heat.",
    "Drilling costs can account for 50% or more of the total capital costs for a geothermal energy project, which makes reducing drilling costs one of the most important factors for geothermal energy production to become economically viable. ",
    "Hydrothermal Spallation Drilling (HSD) is a new form of drilling for hard and brittle rocks.",
    "HSD is able to reduce costs by 15-20% by rapid heating of rock surfaces which allows for the expansion of solid rock under stress.",
    "At a local level, geothermal power plants can provide more than double the long-term jobs per powered household when compared to other utility-scale power-generation technologies",
    "In drier locals, air-cooled binary geothermal power plants use little to no water in operation & can generate electricity from much lower temperatures.",
    "Geothermal is poised to play a key role along with other renewables in reducing Co2 as well as pollutants & smog that come from burning fossil fuels. ",
    "Enhanced Geothermal or EGS is a new technology that can make geothermal energy widely available by creating underground water channels & reservoirs where none existed before.",
    "While ground source heat pumps have a higher installation cost than traditional heating and cooling systems, one heat pump pays for itself in only 10 years.",
